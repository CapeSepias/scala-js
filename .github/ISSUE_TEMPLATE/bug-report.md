<!--
Please follow these steps to help us fixing the bug:

1. Make sure it is a bug for this repo
  * Does it only happen with Scala 3.x? If yes, report it to https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues instead
  * Can you reproduce the bug with Scala/JVM? If yes, report it to https://github.com/scala/bug instead
  * Make sure it is not one of the intended semantic differences: https://www.scala-js.org/doc/semantics.html
  * Does the bug involve macros? If yes, make sure to reproduce *without* macros, or file an issue to the relevant macro library instead or ask on Gitter if it's your own macro
  * Is it about the website? If yes, report it to https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-website/issues instead
  * If in doubt, ask on Gitter first: https://gitter.im/scala-js/scala-js

2. Make sure we can understand and reproduce the bug
  * Give code *and* reproducible steps to provoke the bug
  * Give the version of Scala and Scala.js you are using (if relevant, sbt as well)
  * What did you expect to happen?
  * What actually happened?

If possible, minimize the bug. This helps fixing bugs more quickly. Try to get rid of any external library.

Thank you!
